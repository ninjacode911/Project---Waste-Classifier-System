Waste Classifier System
The Waste Classifier System is an AI-powered project designed to assist in environmental sustainability by accurately classifying waste materials into different categories, such as recyclable, organic, or non-recyclable. This system leverages computer vision and deep learning to analyze images of waste and predict their categories in real-time.

Features
Real-Time Waste Classification:
Analyze waste images captured via a webcam or uploaded by users to classify them into predefined categories.

Pretrained Deep Learning Model:
Utilizes a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on waste datasets for high accuracy.

Intuitive User Interface:
Provides a simple and easy-to-understand interface for interacting with the system.

Environmental Awareness:
Promotes sustainable waste management by encouraging proper segregation.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
How It Works
Image Capture:

The system captures waste images using a webcam or accepts uploaded files.
Preprocessing:

Images are resized, normalized, and prepared for classification.
Classification:

The CNN model processes the image and predicts its category (e.g., recyclable, organic, non-recyclable).
Feedback:

The system provides visual and textual feedback on the predicted waste category, aiding the user in proper disposal.

Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of waste images for training and evaluation. This dataset contains images of common waste items categorized into groups such as:

Recyclable: Plastic bottles, paper, cans.
Organic: Food scraps, garden waste.
Non-Recyclable: Styrofoam, ceramics.
For training your own model, you can use datasets from sources like Kaggle or manually create your dataset.

Future Enhancements
Add multilingual support for wider accessibility.
Expand the waste categories to include e-waste and hazardous materials.
Implement mobile and web applications for better reach.
